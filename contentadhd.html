            <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
            <p>
                A person with an addiction uses a substance, or engages in a behavior, for which the rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeat the activity, despite detrimental consequences. Addiction may involve the use of substances such as alcohol, inhalants, opioids, cocaine, and nicotine, or behaviors such as gambling. <br>
There is evidence that addictive behaviors share key neurobiological features: They intensely involve brain pathways of reward and reinforcement, which involve the neurotransmitter dopamine. And, in keeping with other highly motivated states, they lead to the pruning of synapses in the prefrontal cortex, home of the brain's highest functions, so that attention is highly focused on cues related to the target substance or activity. It is important to know that such brain changes are reversible after the substance use or behavior is discontinued.

            <h2>Symptoms of ADHD</h2>
            <p>
                Recurrent use of a substance, or engagement with an activity, that leads to impairment or distress, is the core of addictive disorders. The clinical diagnosis of an addiction is based on the presence of at least two of a number of features: <br>
->The substance or activity is used in larger amounts or for a longer period of time than was intended. <br>
->There is a desire to cut down on use or unsuccessful efforts to do so. <br>
->Pursuit of the substance or activity, or recovery from its use, consumes a significant amount of time. <br>
->There is a craving or strong desire to use the substance or engage in the activity. <br>
->Use of the substance or activity disrupts obligations at work, school, or home. <br>
->Use of the substance or activity continues despite the social or interpersonal problems it causes. <br>
->Participation in important social, work, or recreational activities drops or stops. <br>
->Use occurs in situations where it is physically risky. <br>
->Use continues despite knowing it is causing or exacerbating physical or psychological problems. <br>
->Tolerance occurs, indicated either by need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect or markedly diminished effect of the same amount of substance. <br>
->Withdrawal occurs, manifest either in the presence of physiological withdrawal symptoms or the taking of a related substance to block them. <br>
The severity of the condition is gauged by the number of symptoms present. The presence of two to three symptoms generally indicates a mild condition; four to five symptoms indicate a moderate disorder. When six or more symptoms are present, the condition is considered severe.

            <h2>Types of ADHD</h2>
            <p>
                Research makes it clear: There is no way to predict who will develop compulsive substance use or gambling behavior.
Addiction is a multi-faceted condition, arising from the confluence of many elements—including, of course, exposure to an addictive agent. It is more accurate to think of risk factors for the development of substance abuse disorders, rather than direct causes. (There are also factors that protect individuals against addiction.)

            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>
                Substance use is a treatable condition and complete remission is entirely possible. Recovery, however, is often a long-term process that may involve multiple attempts. Relapse is now regarded as part of the process, and effective treatment regimens address prevention and management of recurrent use. <br>
Since success tends not to occur all at once, any improvements are considered important signs of progress. Increasingly, programs are available to help those who recognize that they have a substance-use problem but are not ready for complete abstinence. <br>
Because addiction affects so many facets of an individual’s functioning—from the ability to tolerate frustration to establishing and maintaining a productive role in society—good treatment focuses on many dimensions of life, including family roles and work skills as well as mental health. <br>
Treatment can include any of a number of components, which are often deployed in combination and are likely to change over the course of recovery: <br>
->Detoxification, conducted under medical supervision, may be needed but is only the first stage of treatment. <br>
->Medications that reduce or counter use of illicit substances are suitable for some individuals, or medications may be used to target co-occurring disorders such as anxiety and depression. <br>
->Motivational Interviewing, which is a short-term counseling process to help a person resolve ambivalence about treatment and find and hold onto incentives for change. <br>
->Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) can help a person recognize and cope with situations that trigger the desire to use substances. <br>
->Group therapy and other peer-support programs leverage the direct experience of many to support individual recovery and prevent the recurrence of substance use. <br>
->Family therapy helps individuals repair any damage done to family relationships and to establish more supportive ones. <br>
->Life skills training, including employability skills, may be part of an individual's treatment plan. <br>
->Good treatment programs also feature the regular monitoring of individual progress. <br>
